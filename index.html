        <p>
            A slack Bot running on an EKS cluster. Multiple pods running in parallel.
            Falcon has multiple responsibilities; it lets users interact with it through Slack, using commands and dynamically generated UI.
            It provides users with information that's fetched from multiple sources (Jira, PagerDuty, OpsLevel) and processed for the users.
            It alerts the user automatically when an incident under the user's responsibility is triggered in PagerDuty.
            It also runs multiple synchronization tasks that vary in frequency; for example, it sends a weekly report for performance analysis purposes.

        <p>
            A server running on EKS that synchronizes groups in OpsLevel (taken from a config file modified by the company) and provides an API to allow administrators to modify groups.
            A web front-end made in React (with Tailwind) that consumes said API and allows users to: Visualize Groups, Modify Groups, add or remove team members, etc.
        </p>
